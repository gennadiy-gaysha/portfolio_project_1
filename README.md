CARRENT is a car rental and leasing website designed to provide individuals and companies with useful services when renting or leasing a car in several cities across the United States, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, and Boston.

## User Experience (UX)                   

### Project Goals

- The website design should evoke a desire for car trips and travel among users.

- Should visually showcase the fleet of cars available for rental or leasing to users.

- Offer opportunities to the customers to book services once they decided to visit the business.

### User Stories

- As a customer, I want to be able to navigate the website easily and find information about the services offered.

- As a customer, I want to be able to book services quickly and easily.

- As a customer, I want to find out the business's working hours and how to contact them or their representatives.

- As a customer, I want to find links to the business's social media accounts so that I can follow them and stay updated.

### Design 

 - For this project, the [initial design](https://www.figma.com/file/RFOv8bgmCO04pBrn5i2DnS/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1&t=HnHRoD0N402QrTta-1) was [simplified](https://www.figma.com/file/3OIcTkyHELySi8vHELrORu/Project_1?node-id=0%3A1&t=lD2Em3jeoVDLDZ9l-1) using the Figma web application. Later on, during the course of the work, some small amendments were made to the adapted design to ensure that it corresponded to the code that was applied.

  ![Adapted design](assets/img/media/figma.png )

### Typography

 - The main font used in the site is Ubuntu, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case Ubuntu is not being imported correctly. This font was used for all headings, paragraphs, forms, and button values. The Warnes font has been chosen for the site logo with Sans Serif used again as a fallback.

## Finished Product
### For clarity, each section of the already existing website below is presented in 2 screenshots for screens with a width greater than 1200 pixels and less than 480 pixels. In order to not overload this section, screenshots for screens with a width less than 992 pixels and 768 pixels are not displayed.

- Main page - introduces the user to the service, provides all the information for feedback, and allows for easy ordering of the advertised service. In addition, 'Reviews' section, which features unbiased reviews from real customers, further encourages the user to order the service.

| ![main-1200](assets/img/media/main-1200.png)  |![main-480](assets/img/media/main-480.png)   |
|---|---|

- Rent page - contains a simple and intuitive form with necessary prompts. By filling out this form, the user confirms their order by clicking the 'Book Now' button.

|![rent-1200](assets/img/media/rent-1200.png)|![rent-480](assets/img/media/rent-480.png)|

|---|---|

- Sign Up page -  allows the user to easily register on the site by providing their name and email as information. The form is not overloaded with additional questions, which increases user engagement.

|![signup-1200](assets/img/media/signup-1200.png)|![signup-480](assets/img/media/signup-480.png)|
|---|---|

- Final remark - since this is an educational project, a Code Institute link (i.e. https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/) was used for the Post method, which sends information to the server. The fact that the completed form is sent correctly is evidenced by the transition to the server response page (see screenshot below) after clicking the 'Book Now' or 'Sign Up' buttons.
