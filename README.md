Later on, during the course of the work, some small amendments were made to the adapted design to ensure that it corresponded to the code that was applied.

### Typography

 - The main font used in the site is Ubuntu, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case Ubuntu is not being imported correctly. This font was used for all headings, paragraphs, forms, and button values. The Warnes font has been chosen for the site logo with Sans Serif used again as a fallback.
